# RSMAX theme for Moodle

A theme for Moodle 5.3 and later, built as a child of Boost. It gives the site a landing home
page made of blocks, a course page that shows the learner where they are and what comes next,
activity pages with their place in the section, an enrolment page that presents the course, and
a settings panel to adapt colours, typography, header, footer and course pages without code.

## Requirements

- Moodle 5.3 or later.
- The Boost theme, which is part of Moodle.

## Installation

1. Unpack the theme into `public/theme/rsmax`.
2. Visit *Site administration > Notifications* to complete the installation.
3. Choose the theme in *Site administration > Appearance > Themes*.

The `block_pluginia_*` blocks depend on this theme and are installed after it.

## Settings

*Site administration > Appearance > Themes > RSMAX*. Four colours (brand, accent, dark and
background) set the line of the whole site; every other colour follows them unless it is given
a value of its own. The remaining pages cover shapes and typography, header, footer, login,
dashboard, courses and the AI assistant.

## Optional integration

When the *AI assistant* block (`block_openaiagent`) is installed, the theme places it: one in
each new course and one for the site on the home page, the course catalogue and the enrolment
pages. A setting adds a floating button that opens it. The theme works the same without it.

## Privacy

The theme stores no personal data. It keeps, for each course, the banners uploaded by its
teachers and where they are shown.

Nothing is requested from other sites when a page loads. The font (Inter) is bundled with the
theme. Two things reach an external service, and only after the visitor presses them:

- A video block with a YouTube or Vimeo address loads the player from
  `youtube-nocookie.com` or `player.vimeo.com`.
- The map of the contact block (`block_pluginia_contact`) loads Google Maps.

## Third party code

- Inter typeface, SIL Open Font License 1.1 (`fonts/`, declared in `thirdpartylibs.xml`).
